# 💸 Anti-Money Laundering Detection System (Big Data Pipeline)

This project builds a scalable and efficient Big Data pipeline to detect suspicious financial transactions using Apache Spark, machine learning models (GBT, XGBoost), and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Designed for high-volume data, the system can process, classify, and visualize large-scale transactional behavior in real-time or batch mode.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **High-Volume Data Processing**: Built with PySpark to handle and transform millions of records.
- **Advanced ML Models**: Trained with both Spark MLlib’s Gradient Boosted Trees and XGBoost for classification.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Streamlit interface allows single transaction evaluation on-the-fly.
- **Batch Risk Analysis**: Upload large CSVs (up to 2GB+) and get immediate risk classifications.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Modular code, model serialization, and environment setup included.

## 🔄 Workflow Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Reads the IBM HI-Small AML dataset using `SparkSession.read.csv()` with inferred schema.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Groups data by account ID and applies custom aggregations.
- Derives features like:
  - Transaction count
  - Average/standard deviation of amounts
  - Hour-based time buckets
  - Custom metrics via `percentile_approx`

### 3️⃣ Labeling Suspicious Transactions
- Parses semi-structured `.txt` logs using regex to identify laundering tags.
- Joins labels to main dataset to create a complete training matrix.

### 4️⃣ Model Training
- Models used:
  - `GBTClassifier` from Spark MLlib
  - `XGBoostClassifier` (using joblib for persistence)
- Training on PySpark-generated features.

### 5️⃣ Streamlit Dashboard
- **Single Transaction Mode**: Enter values to get instant classification
- **Batch Mode**: Upload full transaction files (CSV) for scoring
- Model switcher to compare GBT vs. XGBoost results

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Spark Feature Pipeline
Run the preprocessing and feature engineering code from the `code/` folder using PySpark.

### Step 3: Launch Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
